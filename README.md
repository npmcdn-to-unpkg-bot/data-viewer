#data-viewer

Web-based system to show data from web. 

NOTE: you need MongoDB databse to run this system.

Application menu-structure is defined into MongoDB database. Application 
structure can have several "systems". Each system consists of hierarchical 
menu items and functions which are linked to menuitems.

Data is loaded from different sources, such as open data REST services, 
weather camera pictures etc.

Example structure:
WEATHER CAMERA SYSTEM (type: system)
	Tampere region cameras (type: menuitem)
		Road 3 Sasi, towards Tampere (type: menuitem)
			weather cam C0450601 (type: function)
		Road 65 Kuru, towards Tampere (type: menuitem)
			weather cam C0451002 (type: function)
		Road 9 Orivesi, towards Tampere  (type: menuitem)
			weather cam C0451302 (type: function)

Application loads all systems to the main page and user can select system
by clicking system name. When system opens it shows system menu. If single 
menu item has functions specified, menuitem is shows as a link. When clicking 
link, functions are launched and new page opens. Page shows data which 
is generated by menuitem functions.

Version 1.0 has restricted functionality. It is able to show systems and system's menu.
This versions supports only one module, finnish weather cameras. You need to 
insert documents to database manually. User interface to specify systems and menus 
is coming later.
		
This application is implemented to test different web technologies and application 
uses several different technologies: NodeJs, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, 
JADE templates, JQuery, BootStrap, log4js logging... Application internal interfaces
