#data-viewer

Web-based system to show data from web. 

Application menu-structure is defined into MongoDB database. Application 
structure can have several "systems". Each system consists of hierarchical 
menu items and functions which are linked to menuitems.

Data is loaded from different sources, such as open data REST services, 
weather camera pictures etc.

Example structure:
WEATHER CAMERA SYSTEM (type: system)
	Tampere region cameras (type: menuitem)
		Road 3 Sasi, towards Tampere (type: menuitem)
			weather cam C0450601 (type: function)
		Road 65 Kuru, towards Tampere (type: menuitem)
			weather cam C0451002 (type: function)
		Road 9 Orivesi, towards Tampere  (type: menuitem)
			weather cam C0451302 (type: function)

Application loads all systems to the main page and user can select system
by clicking system name. When system opens it shows system menu. If single 
menu item has functions specified, menuitem is shown as a link. When clicking 
a link, functions are launched and new page opens. Page shows data which 
is generated by menuitem's functions.

Current version has restricted functionality. It is able to show systems and 
system's menu and this version supports three modules: simple text,
 finnish weather cameras and traffic statistics module. 
 You must insert documents to database manually. User interface to specify
 systems and menus is coming later.
		
This application is implemented to test different web technologies and application 
uses several different technologies: NodeJs, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, 
JADE templates, JQuery, BootStrap, log4js logging, unirest, xml handling... 
Application internal interfaces are implemented as REST services.

You need MongoDB databse to run this system. Follow these instructions:
1. Create a new MongoDB database
2. Insert demo material into db: systems, menuitems and functions. These are dumped
as JSON in directory /DEMO-database.
3. Copy file ./config.json_TEMPLATE to new name: ./config.json
4. Edit config.json and add your MongoDB database address.

After configuring database you are ready to lauch server: npm start
